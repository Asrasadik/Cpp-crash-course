(static/early binding)->during compilation -> compile time polymorphism
(dynamic/late binding)->during running -> run time polymorphism

benifits of function overloading:
1. naming burden
2. reuse
3. readability

// operator overloading
//basic types of overloading are:-
* unary
* binary
* relational

// in binary operator overloading
called by before op and passed to operator overloading by after

//function overriding
static resolution
property of static resolution is early binding
since the pointer is of parent class it exhibits the behaviour of static resolution
it binds the parent class function to the object at compile time 

* runtime poly is achieved using virtual keyword
*decision is made at run time hence runtime poly
